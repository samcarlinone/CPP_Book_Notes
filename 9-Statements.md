# Statements
_(The C++ Programming Language Chapter 9, ed. 4, by Bjarne Stroustrup)_

Most of the statements are similar to other languages, and relatively straightforward.

### Range-for Statements
If we want to modify the values should use a reference
```c++
for(int& x: v)
  ++x;
```

That's about it, if you know how to code already this stuff is pretty basic
